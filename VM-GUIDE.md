# VM guide: create, open to SSH, monitor

How to create a VM on the server and give someone access to it, without giving them access to the server. Follow it once per VM.

These commands are for **LXD 4.0 on Ubuntu 20.04**, which is why ports are forwarded with proxy devices and not `lxc network forward`. After a move to Incus, replace `lxc` with `incus` and `lxdbr0` with `incusbr0`.

To do sections 1 to 5 in one go, run `sudo ./create-vm.sh` on the server. It asks for each value, then gives you the SSH command to hand over. Section 7 onwards still applies to VMs created this way.

Each block says where to run it:

| Label | Machine |
|---|---|
| **Server** | The Ubuntu server running LXD, logged in over SSH |
| **Mac** | Your personal computer |
| **Inside the VM** | A shell opened with `sudo lxc shell <name>` |

## 1. Check there is room

**Server:**

```bash
free -h                            # RAM available on the server
sudo lxc storage info default      # disk space left in the storage pool
sudo lxc list                      # existing VMs and the IPs already used
```

Keep the RAM of all VMs added together below what the server has, with some left over for the server itself.

## 2. Choose the values for this VM

Four values must be different for every VM:

| Value | Why it must be unique | Example |
|---|---|---|
| Name | Identifies the VM in every command | `vm2` |
| VM IP | Two VMs can't share an address | `10.158.92.11` |
| SSH port | One server port can only lead to one VM | `2223` |
| App ports on the server | Same reason (see section 7) | `5556` |

**Server:** these two commands give you the values to build on.

```bash
sudo lxc network get lxdbr0 ipv4.address   # your subnet, e.g. 10.158.92.1/24
ip -br a                                   # the server IP on the main interface
```

A VM IP keeps the first three numbers of the subnet. Choose a last number from 2 to 254 that `lxc list` doesn't show.

Keep track of what you assign:

| VM | VM IP | SSH port | App ports | RAM | CPU | Disk | User |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| vm1 | | 2222 | | | | | |
| vm2 | | 2223 | | | | | |

## 3. Create and start the VM

**Server:** set the values for this VM. Run this first, and run everything after it in the same terminal.

```bash
VM=vm2
VM_USER=bob
VM_IP=10.158.92.11
SSH_PORT=2223
RAM=4GiB
CPUS=2
DISK=20GiB
SERVER_IP=203.0.113.25
```

**Server:** create the VM. `lxc init` creates it without starting it, so everything can be set up before the first boot and you avoid the stop/start that devices need on this LXD version.

```bash
sudo lxc init ubuntu:24.04 "$VM" --vm -c limits.memory="$RAM" -c limits.cpu="$CPUS"
sudo lxc config device override "$VM" root size="$DISK"
sudo lxc config device override "$VM" eth0 ipv4.address="$VM_IP"
sudo lxc config device add "$VM" ssh-forward proxy \
  listen=tcp:"$SERVER_IP":"$SSH_PORT" \
  connect=tcp:"$VM_IP":22 \
  nat=true
sudo lxc start "$VM"
```

**Server:** wait until the VM has finished booting. This usually takes under a minute. If it never returns, press Ctrl+C and check `sudo lxc info "$VM" --show-log`.

```bash
until sudo lxc exec "$VM" -- true 2>/dev/null; do sleep 2; done
sudo lxc exec "$VM" -- cloud-init status --wait
```

## 4. Create the user and allow password login

**Server:** create the account. It asks you to choose the password, and you can press Enter through the name questions.

```bash
sudo lxc exec "$VM" -- adduser "$VM_USER"
```

**Server:** allow password login for this user only. All other accounts stay key-only.

```bash
sudo lxc exec "$VM" -- sh -c "printf '\nMatch User $VM_USER\n    PasswordAuthentication yes\n' >> /etc/ssh/sshd_config && mkdir -p /run/sshd && sshd -t && systemctl restart ssh"
```

**Server:** only if this user needs to be admin of the VM. They stay limited to the VM.

```bash
sudo lxc exec "$VM" -- usermod -aG sudo "$VM_USER"
```

**Server:** install fail2ban, then check that it's watching SSH.

```bash
sudo lxc exec "$VM" -- sh -c "apt-get update && apt-get install -y fail2ban"
sudo lxc exec "$VM" -- fail2ban-client status sshd
```

## 5. Open the firewall

**Server:** allow forwarded traffic to the VM. The port here is the one **inside the VM** (22), not the server port.

```bash
sudo ufw route allow proto tcp to "$VM_IP" port 22
```

**Hosting provider's panel:** if it has a firewall, allow TCP on the server port (`2223` in this example).

## 6. Test, then hand over access

**Server:** test the VM directly. You should get a password prompt.

```bash
ssh "$VM_USER@$VM_IP"
```

**Mac:** test from outside, using the real values.

```bash
ssh -p 2223 bob@203.0.113.25
```

Give the person that command and their password. Use at least 16 random characters, because this port is open to the whole internet. Tell them that several wrong passwords in a row lock them out for about 10 minutes.

### Your own access (optional)

You can always get in from the server without any setup:

**Server:**

```bash
sudo lxc shell "$VM"
```

To connect directly from your Mac, add your key to the VM.

**Mac:** copy your public key.

```bash
pbcopy < ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
```

**Server:** paste it in place of `PASTE_YOUR_KEY_HERE`.

```bash
sudo lxc exec "$VM" -- sh -c '
  mkdir -p /home/ubuntu/.ssh &&
  echo "PASTE_YOUR_KEY_HERE" >> /home/ubuntu/.ssh/authorized_keys &&
  chown -R ubuntu:ubuntu /home/ubuntu/.ssh &&
  chmod 700 /home/ubuntu/.ssh &&
  chmod 600 /home/ubuntu/.ssh/authorized_keys'
```

**Mac:** add one block per VM to `~/.ssh/config`. This assumes the `Host prod` block for the server is already there. After that, `ssh vm2` connects you through the server.

```
Host vm2
    HostName 10.158.92.11
    User ubuntu
    ProxyJump prod
```

## 7. Forward an app port (optional)

Do this when the VM runs a website or backend. Two VMs can use the same port inside, but each needs its own port on the server. Here port `5556` on the server leads to port `5555` in the VM.

**Server:** the VM must be stopped to add a device.

```bash
sudo lxc stop "$VM"
sudo lxc config device add "$VM" web-5555 proxy \
  listen=tcp:"$SERVER_IP":5556 \
  connect=tcp:"$VM_IP":5555 \
  nat=true
sudo lxc start "$VM"
sudo ufw route allow proto tcp to "$VM_IP" port 5555
```

Allow TCP `5556` in the hosting provider's firewall too. The site is then at `http://<server-ip>:5556/`.

The app must listen on `0.0.0.0`, not `127.0.0.1`. Check with `sudo lxc exec "$VM" -- ss -tlnp`.

## 8. Monitor

**All VMs**, on the **server**:

```bash
sudo lxc list                 # state and IP of every VM
sudo lxc list -c ns4mDu       # adds memory, disk and CPU usage
```

**One VM**, on the **server**:

```bash
sudo lxc info vm2                         # state, resources and network
sudo lxc config show vm2                  # RAM, CPU and other settings
sudo lxc config device show vm2           # disk, IP and forwarded ports
sudo lxc exec vm2 -- free -h              # RAM seen inside the VM
sudo lxc exec vm2 -- df -h /              # disk seen inside the VM
sudo lxc exec vm2 -- uptime               # load and time since boot
```

**Who is connecting**, on the **server**:

```bash
sudo lxc exec vm2 -- who                           # logged in right now
sudo lxc exec vm2 -- last -n 10                    # recent logins
sudo lxc exec vm2 -- fail2ban-client status sshd   # banned IPs
```

**The server itself**, on the **server**:

```bash
free -h
df -h
sudo lxc storage info default
sudo lxc info --resources
```

## 9. Daily management

All on the **server**:

| Task | Command |
|---|---|
| Start, stop, restart | `sudo lxc start vm2`, `sudo lxc stop vm2`, `sudo lxc restart vm2` |
| Force a stuck VM to stop | `sudo lxc stop vm2 --force` |
| Open a shell | `sudo lxc shell vm2` |
| Open the console (leave with Ctrl+a, then q) | `sudo lxc console vm2` |
| Change the RAM or CPU (stop the VM first) | `sudo lxc config set vm2 limits.memory=8GiB limits.cpu=4` |
| Grow the disk (it can't shrink) | `sudo lxc config device set vm2 root size=40GiB` |
| Take a snapshot before a risky change | `sudo lxc snapshot vm2 before-change` |
| Go back to a snapshot | `sudo lxc restore vm2 before-change` |
| Reset a user's password | `sudo lxc exec vm2 -- passwd bob` |
| Unban an IP | `sudo lxc exec vm2 -- fail2ban-client set sshd unbanip <ip>` |

Disk growth usually applies after the next restart.

## 10. Remove access or delete a VM

All on the **server**.

Remove one person, and keep the VM:

```bash
sudo lxc exec vm2 -- deluser --remove-home bob
```

Close a forwarded port, and keep the VM:

```bash
sudo lxc stop vm2
sudo lxc config device remove vm2 ssh-forward
sudo lxc start vm2
```

Delete a VM. **This can't be undone:** its disk and snapshots are gone.

```bash
sudo lxc delete vm2 --force
sudo ufw status numbered       # find the VM's rules
sudo ufw delete <number>       # repeat for each; the numbers shift after each delete
```

## 11. Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Likely cause | What to do |
|---|---|---|
| `Connection timed out` from outside | A firewall is blocking the traffic | Redo section 5, including the hosting provider's firewall |
| `Connection refused` from outside, but `ssh` from the server works | fail2ban banned that IP (bans lift after about 10 minutes) | Run `fail2ban-client status sshd`, then unban the IP |
| `Connection refused` from the server too | SSH isn't running, or the IP is wrong | Check `sudo lxc list`, then `sudo lxc exec vm2 -- ss -tlnp` for `:22` |
| `Permission denied` with no password prompt | Password login isn't enabled for this user | Redo the password step in section 4 |
| `Permission denied` after typing the password | Wrong password | Reset it with `passwd` (section 9) |
| `Device cannot be added when instance is running` | LXD 4.0 needs the VM stopped | Stop the VM, add the device, start it |
| `VM agent isn't currently running` | The VM is still booting | Wait 30 seconds and try again |
| `unknown command "forward"` | LXD 4.0 doesn't have this command | Use a proxy device (section 3) |
| A website gets `Connection refused` | The app only listens on `127.0.0.1` | Make it listen on `0.0.0.0` |

To see where an SSH connection stops, add `-v`: `ssh -v -p 2223 bob@<server-ip>`.
